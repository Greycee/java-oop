Origin Object Oriented Programming

* Low-level programming 
* Linear programming
* Structured programming
* Modular programming
* Object Oriented Programming (designed by Alan Kay/first language: Smalltalk)

Advantages:

* Reliable: Isolating parts generates a secure software. When changing one piece of code, no other is affected.
* Timely: By dividing everything into parts, several of them can be developed in parallel.
* Easy maintenance: Updating a software is easier. A small modification will benefit all the parts using the object.
* Extensible: A software is not static. It must grow to remain useful.
* Reusable: We can use an object from a system that we created in another future system.
* Natural: Easier to understand. You care more about functionality than implementation details.


In order to code in Java, we must install JDK and Netbeans.
