Object

Material and abstract things that can be perceived and described through its 
* characteristics (atributes),
* behaviors (methods),
* current state

Class: defines the atributes and methods shared by an object. It deals with relationships between classes and their subclasses - inheritance - they are static, fixed at compile time.

Object is an instance of a class

Abstraction: Ignores all the atributes that are not important in a class. Hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency. 

How to create classes and objects in Java:

Netbeans: 
New project, 
Choose Java - Java Application, 
Give the project a name, 
Let all the options checked,
It then generates the package that looks like this - This is the class with the method main:

package project1;
public class Project1 {
  public static void main(String[] args){
  }
}

In order to create a class: 

click on the package name on the left side (yellow package),
New - Java class,
Give the class a name - every class starts with an uppercase letter

Adding the atributes and methods to it, it looks like this:

package project1;
public class Pen{
  String model;
  String color;
  float tip;
  int refill;
  boolean isLidOn;

  void status() {
    System.out.println(this.color + "pen");
    System.out.println("Model: " + this.model);
    System.out.println("Tip: " + this.tip);
    System.out.println("Refill: " + this.refill);
    System.out.println("Is with the lid on? " + this.isLidOn);
  }

  void scribble() {
    if (this.isLidOn){
      System.out.println("Error! I can't scribble because the lid is on!");
    } else {
      System.out.println("I am scribbling some stuff!");
    }
  }

  void addLid() {
    this.isLidOn = true
  }
  
  void removeLid() {
    this.isLidOn = false
  }
}

How to instantiate an object:
On the main class:

package project1;
public class Project1 {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Pen p1 = new Pen()
    p1.color = "Blue";
    p1.tip = 0.5f;
    p1.addLid();

    p1.status();
    p1.scribble()

    Pen p2 = new Pen()
    p2.model = "Bic";
    p2.color = "Red";
    p2.tip = 0.7f;
    p2.removeLid();

    p2.status();
    p2.scribble()
  }
}

When pressing run the program generates:

Blue pen 
Model: null
Tip: 0.5
Refill: 0
Is with the lid on? true
Error! I can't scribble because the lid is on!

Red pen 
Model: Bic
Tip: 0.7
Refill: 0
Is with the lid on? false
I am scribbling some stuff!
