Visibility

+ Public -> that class and all the other classes have access
- Private -> just that class have access 
# Protected -> that class and their subclasses


Adding visibility to the class: 

package project1;
public class Pen{
  public String model;
  public String color;
  private float tip;
  protected int refill;
  private boolean isLidOn;

  public void status() {
    // ...
  }

  public void scribble() {
    // ...
  }

  public void addLid() {
    this.isLidOn = true
  }
  
  public void removeLid() {
    this.isLidOn = false
  }
}

Running the code: 

package project1;
public class Project1 {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Pen p1 = new Pen();
    p1.isLidOn = false  // I can't do this because isLidOn is private
    p1.removeLid() // I can do this because the removeLid method is public although it contains its private attribute.
  }
}
