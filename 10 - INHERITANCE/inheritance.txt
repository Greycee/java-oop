Inheritance

It allows to base a new class on the definition of another class existing previously.

  It applies for the characteristics and for the behaviors.

  Student          Teacher         Staff Member
  - name           - name          - name
  - age            - age           - age
  - sex            - sex           - sex 
  - register       - subject       - area
  - course         - salary        - working

 + celebBday()     + celebBday()   + celebBday()
 + cancRegist()    + getRaise()    + changeRole()

 Through inheritance we generate a new class with the common atribuites and methods and keep only the specific ones on the other classes:


Person          Student          Teacher         Staff Member
- name          - register       - subject       - area
- age           - course         - salary        - working 
- sex            
 
+ celebBday()    cancRegist()    + getRaise()    + changeRole()


Now we can say that the Student class extends Person, the teacher class extends Person and the Staff Member class extends Person.

Person is the mother class (superclass) and Student, Teacher and Staff Member are the children (subclasses).
